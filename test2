What is GIT
Linux Torvalds
git
manage version.
parelal development is possible in GIT.
Git is versioning tool.
Git insialised === 
when we use command git init then we define that , this is my local repo.
Every single local repo user update on remote repo.
if they have merge issue, then developer will solve this issue.
git we do file level changes so we required versioning .sha hashing size is 42 bit .so we dont have commits limit.
when we do git init then git create one hidden folder
Logical changes go towares GIT
Physical changes in our machine volume.
when we add and commit in local directory then it become local repo.
to use  this local repo to other user, we push this code to remote repo.
origin = remote repo address




maintain a history.
diffrence between svn and git
svn is cnetralised
git is distributed+ centralised.
Distrubuted:- 
centralised:-
you dont have limits of commit.

How git working?
1)working directory:- normal directory in a operating system having  a disk space to work on.making code in working directory.
git initialised 
when  we create file in wokring directory, so that file in untrack stage.
use git status calc.pyc----check status
when we add this file in git, so that file in track or staging stage
git add -A calc.pyc
-a use to all directory like
if we have multiple sub directores ,so if we use -a then git will add each main and sub directory.
-A only add file which avaiable in current directory.
* will add all untrack file.

git commit-get hash id.if we dont set user id , email id, then git will force to enter same information.
after commiting file its go to local repo enviourmant.
git -m "message" file name
git log===check status of file
git reflog
git push ===command use to send code to remote directory
best pratice-always do first git pull and then git push
pull -fetch and merger
fetch genrally avoid.
git push=system should know , what is my remote repo.
git clone===
***remote origan address***
git remote -v
required communication between remote and local repo. we use either http or ssh protocol for commnucation.Also required authentication.
